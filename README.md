<h1>Description</h1>
The following are the rules that are applied in the game: <br>
 At the start of the game, the player will have instructions about how many letters the secret word 
contains and how many guesses and warnings are remaining. <br>
 The Users start with 6 guesses and 3 warnings. <br>
 The program will keeps track of all the letters the player has not guessed so far and before each 
turn it will shows the player the remaining letters. <br>
 One guess at a time should be requested from the player. The player should be informed whether 
the letter is in the secret word right away after each guess. Additionally, the secret word will be 
revealed after right to the player, and replacing any characters that were not correctly predicted 
with an underscore and a space. <br>
 Both capitals and lowercase characters are acceptable guesses in this game. Ask the player to 
enter valid input if they enter anything other than the alphabet. <br>
 The player does not lose any guesses or warnings if they enter a letter that hasn't been guessed 
before and is part of the secret word. <br>
 If a player enters a consonant that hasn't been guessed and isn't present in the secret word, they 
lose one guess. <br>
 The player loses two guesses if the vowel isn't in the secret word and hasn't been guessed. <br>
 The player loses a warning each time they enter something other than an alphabet (symbols, 
digits) or a letter that has previously been guessed. The player loses a guess if there are no 
warnings left. <br>
 When a player forms the entire word or runs out of guesses, the game should be over. <br>
 The game is over and the word is revealed if the player runs out of guesses before finishing the 
word. The game ends.<br>
